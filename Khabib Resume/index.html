                    <li>Nurmagomedov employs a wrestling-based style of relentless pressure against his opponents, often described as "mauling"</li>
                    <li> Using a variety of wrestling and judo/sambo takedowns, he forces his opponents against the cage, and locks up their legs and an arm to prevent them from escaping.</li>
                    <li>From this position, he exhausts his opponents by forcing his weight against them and attacks with measured strikes his opponents are often unable to defend.</li>
                    <li>This was one of his many signature styles that he used to deploy to advance towards his finishing move.</li>
                    <li>Throughout his career, nineteen of his twenty-nine victories had come by way of either TKO/KO or submission.</li>    
                    <li>MMA Commentator Joe Rogan, a black belt in both 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, said of Nurmagomedov, “He’s the most terrifying lightweight contender in the world,” and “he’s just on such another level [of grappling] that the odds of beating him drop significantly after the first minute-and-a-half.</li>
                    <li>UFC referee Herb Dean stated Nurmagomedov constantly talks to his opponents during fights.</li>
